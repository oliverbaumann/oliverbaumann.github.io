[Curriculum Vitae (December 2023)](http://oliverbaumann.github.io/files/Oliver_Baumann_CV_December2023.pdf)

I am a Professor of Strategy and Organization at the [University of Southern Denmark (SDU)](https://sdu.dk), where I lead the [Strategic Organization Design](http://www.sod-research.com) research unit at the [Department of Business and Management](https://www.sdu.dk/en/om-sdu/institutter-centre/i_virksomhedsledelse). I am also affiliated with the [Digital Democracy Center](www.sdu.dk/ddc). 

My research examines how organizations learn, adapt, and innovate under uncertainty. A central theme of my work is organization design: how firms can deliberately architect structures, information flows, and decision processes to manage complexity, foster adaptation, and mobilize knowledge for positive impact. Much of my research focuses on the behavioral micro-foundations of strategic and organizational decision making, studying how individual psychology, social interaction, and organizational structure jointly shape collaborative problem solving.

Methodologically, I develop formal theories of organizations as complex adaptive systems, using computational modeling and simulation (including NK landscapes and reinforcement learning). I complement this work with laboratory experiments, in-depth field studies, and computational social science approaches that leverage digital trace data, text, and networks.

My current agenda targets a set of pressing, contemporary design challenges. One stream investigates performance feedback, interpretation, and the design of evaluative systems — how organizations "judge" performance as well as "act" on it — and how the architecture of evaluation (metrics, scope, aggregation) shapes exploration, experimentation, and learning. 

A second stream examines organization design under technological change, including flat and AI-augmented forms of organizing and the implications of hierarchy for adaptive search in turbulent environments. In parallel, through the Digital Democracy Center, I study the adaptation of news ecosystems and professional content platforms, including how platform reliance and crisis-induced shifts in collaboration reshape information diversity and the distribution of voice—issues that matter for democratic discourse. 

More recently, I have begun exploring Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and smart contract ecosystems as an emerging design space for coordination and governance. I explore the possibilities (and limits) of distributing authority, participation, and accountability through code.

I am a co-editor of the [Journal of Organization Design](https://www.springer.com/journal/41469) and serve on the editorial boards of Academy of Management Discoveries, Organization Science, and the Strategic Management Journal. My research has been published in outlets including Administrative Science Quarterly, Advances in Strategic Management, Journal of Management, Organization Science, and the Strategic Management Journal.

I received a PhD in Business Economics from LMU Munich, an MS in Industrial Engineering from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and an MS in Engineering Management from Portland State University. Prior to joining SDU, I held a faculty position at LMU Munich and was a visiting scholar at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.
