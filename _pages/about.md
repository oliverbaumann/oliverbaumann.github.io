[Curriculum Vitae (December 2023)](http://oliverbaumann.github.io/files/Oliver_Baumann_CV_December2023.pdf)

I am a Professor of Strategic Organization Design at the [University of Southern Denmark (SDU)](https://sdu.dk), where I head the [Strategic Organization Design](http://www.sod-research.com) research unit at the [Department of Business and Management](https://www.sdu.dk/en/om-sdu/institutter-centre/i_virksomhedsledelse). In addition, I am affiliated with the [Digital Democracy Center](www.sdu.dk/ddc). 

My research tackles fundamental questions at the intersection of organization, strategy, and innovation. Fascinated by organizations as complex adaptive systems, I seek to understand how they can effectively navigate uncertainty, complexity, and technological change. I investigate questions such as: How does organizational design shape a firm's ability to solve complex, interdependent problems? And how do design choices influence organizational learning and adaptation, particularly in dynamic environments?

In addressing these questions, I work primarily with computational modeling and simulation (computational social science). This theoretical work is complemented by conceptual projects, in-depth field studies of individual firms, and work using big datasets. A grant from the Independent Research Fund Denmark has enabled me to migrate computational models into web-based experimental platforms, allowing for rigorous testing of theories with human subjects.

My research agenda is relevant to contemporary challenges, examining topics like the role of performance feedback, the design of flat or AI-driven organizations, or effective search strategies. I have recently also started to work on the potential and challenges of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and smart contracts.

I am a co-editor of the [Journal of Organization Design](https://www.springer.com/journal/41469) and serve on the editorial boards of Academy of Management Discoveries, Organization Science, and the Strategic Management Journal. My research has been published in Administrative Science Quarterly, Advances in Strategic Management, Journal of Management, Organization Science, and the Strategic Management Journal, among others.

I received a PhD in Business Economics from LMU Munich, an MS in Industrial Engineering from the University of Karlsruhe, and an MS in Engineering Management from Portland State University. Prior to joining the University of Southern Denmark, I was a visiting scholar at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and an Assistant Professor at LMU Munich.
