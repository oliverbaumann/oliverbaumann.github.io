I am a Professor of Strategy and Organization Design at the [University of Southern Denmark (SDU)](https://www.sdu.dk), where I lead the [Strategic Organization Design](http://www.sod-research.com) research unit at the Department of Business and Management. I am also affiliated with the [Digital Democracy Center](https://www.sdu.dk/ddc).

My research examines the architecture of adaptation: how organizations design structures and decision processes to learn and innovate under uncertainty. I combine computational modeling (including NK landscapes and reinforcement learning), experiments, field studies, and digital trace data to understand how formal design interacts with behavior.
