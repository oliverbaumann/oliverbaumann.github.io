[Curriculum Vitae (December 2023)](http://oliverbaumann.github.io/files/Oliver_Baumann_CV_December2023.pdf)

I am a Professor of Strategy and Organization at the [University of Southern Denmark (SDU)](https://sdu.dk), where I head the [Strategic Organization Design](http://www.sod-research.com) research unit at the [Department of Business and Management](https://www.sdu.dk/en/om-sdu/institutter-centre/i_virksomhedsledelse). In addition, I am affiliated with the [Digital Democracy Center](www.sdu.dk/ddc). 

My research investigates how organizations learn, adapt, and innovate in complex and dynamic environments. I focus on the behavioral and cognitive micro-foundations of strategic decision-making, examining how individual psychology, social interactions, and incentive structures shape processes of exploration, exploitation, and collaborative problem-solving. A central theme is organization design, exploring how firms can architect their structures, processes, and inter-organizational relationships to effectively manage complexity.

To study these dynamics, my work utilizes computational modeling and simulation, drawing on frameworks such as NK landscapes and reinforcement learning to develop formal theories of organizational behavior within complex adaptive systems. This theoretical work is complemented by laboratory experiments, in-depth field studies of individual firms, and work using big datasets (computational social science). 

My research agenda is relevant to contemporary challenges, examining topics like the role of performance feedback, the design of flat or AI-driven organizations, or effective search strategies. I have recently also started to work on the potential and challenges of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and smart contracts.

I am a co-editor of the [Journal of Organization Design](https://www.springer.com/journal/41469) and serve on the editorial boards of Academy of Management Discoveries, Organization Science, and the Strategic Management Journal. My research has been published in Administrative Science Quarterly, Advances in Strategic Management, Journal of Management, Organization Science, and the Strategic Management Journal, among others.

I received a PhD in Business Economics from LMU Munich, an MS in Industrial Engineering from the University of Karlsruhe, and an MS in Engineering Management from Portland State University. Prior to joining the University of Southern Denmark, I was a visiting scholar at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and an Assistant Professor at LMU Munich.
