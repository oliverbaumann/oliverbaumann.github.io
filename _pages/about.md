[Curriculum Vitae (December 2023)](http://oliverbaumann.github.io/files/Oliver_Baumann_CV_December2023.pdf)

I am a Professor of Strategy and Organization Design at the [University of Southern Denmark (SDU)](https://sdu.dk), where I lead the [Strategic Organization Design](http://www.sod-research.com) research unit at the [Department of Business and Management](https://www.sdu.dk/en/om-sdu/institutter-centre/i_virksomhedsledelse). I am also affiliated with the [Digital Democracy Center](www.sdu.dk/ddc). 

My research explores the **architecture of adaptation**: how organizations design structures, information flows, and decision processes to learn and innovate in complex and dynamic environments. It views organizations as complex adaptive systems, bridging macro-level design with behavioral micro-foundations to understand how individual cognition, social comparison, and formal structure jointly determine collective problem solving.

Methodologically, I build formal theory using computational modeling (NK landscapes, reinforcement learning) and complement this work with laboratory experiments, in-depth field studies, and computational social science approaches that leverage digital trace data.

My current agenda addresses three interconnected design challenges. 

1. **Performance systems and organizational learning**. How do organizations design evaluative architectures — the metrics, scope, and aggregation of performance feedback — and how do these choices shape search and adaptation? I examine both how organizations "judge" performance and how they "act" on it, including the surprising benefits of inaccurate reporting and the role of social comparisons in driving search behavior. 

2. **Organization design for technological disruption**. At the firm level, I investigate how structures must evolve when AI augments human decision-making. At the ecosystem level, specifically within digital news, I analyze adaptation to platform dominance. This includes studying how AI-generated content impacts information diversity and how structural dependencies — such as platform reliance and crisis-induced coordination — reshape democratic discourse.

3. **Decentralized coordination and algorithmic governance**. Can we design organizations without traditional hierarchy? I explore Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and smart contract ecosystems as laboratories for reimagining coordination, investigating the possibilities and limits of distributing authority, participation, and accountability through code.

I am a co-editor of the [Journal of Organization Design](https://www.springer.com/journal/41469) and serve on the editorial boards of Academy of Management Discoveries, Organization Science, and the Strategic Management Journal. My research has been published in Administrative Science Quarterly, Journal of Management, Organization Science, the Strategic Management Journal, among others.

I received a PhD in Business Economics from LMU Munich, an MS in Industrial Engineering and Management from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and an MS in Engineering Management from Portland State University. Prior to joining SDU, I was an Assistant Professor at LMU Munich and a visiting scholar at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.
