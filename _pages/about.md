[Curriculum Vitae (December 2023)](http://oliverbaumann.github.io/files/Oliver_Baumann_CV_December2023.pdf)

I am a Professor of Strategy and Organization Design at the [University of Southern Denmark (SDU)](https://sdu.dk), where I lead the [Strategic Organization Design](http://www.sod-research.com) research unit at the [Department of Business and Management](https://www.sdu.dk/en/om-sdu/institutter-centre/i_virksomhedsledelse). I am also affiliated with the [Digital Democracy Center](www.sdu.dk/ddc). 

My research explores the **architecture of adaptation**: how organizations design structures, information flows, and decision processes to learn and innovate in complex environments. I am particularly interested in how organizational intelligence emerges—or fails to emerge—across distinct logics of organizing: from the vertical control of traditional hierarchies to the hybrid intelligence of human-AI systems and the radical decentralization of algorithmic governance.

I treat organizations as complex adaptive systems, bridging macro-level design with behavioral micro-foundations to understand how individual cognition, social interaction, and formal structure jointly determine collective problem-solving. Methodologically, I build formal theory using computational modeling (NK landscapes, reinforcement learning) and complement this work with laboratory experiments, in-depth field studies, and computational social science approaches that leverage digital trace data.

My current agenda investigates adaptation across three organizational configurations: 

1. **Adaptation in hierarchies:** *How do traditional structures learn?* I examine how the design of performance feedback systems—which metrics are tracked, whose performance is compared, and how information is aggregated—shapes organizational search. My work reveals the behavioral realities of evaluation, showing how social comparisons drive search intensity and how the strategic "sugarcoating" of performance information can paradoxically enhance exploration by shielding promising projects from premature abandonment. 

2. **Adaptation in human-AI systems:** *How do augmented organizations decide?* I investigate the structural implications of AI and platform dominance. At the firm level, I ask how decision rights, information flows, and hierarchies must evolve when algorithms augment or replace human judgment. At the ecosystem level, I analyze how digital news organizations adapt to platform algorithms, studying how AI-generated content and platform dependencies reshape information diversity and democratic discourse.

3. **Adaptation in decentralized networks:** *How do self-governing systems coordinate?* I explore Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and smart contract ecosystems as laboratories for radical organizational design. These systems replace managerial authority with algorithmic governance, distributing decision rights through code and token-based mechanisms. I investigate whether such designs can sustain effective coordination, meaningful participation, and accountability without traditional hierarchy.

I am a co-editor of the [Journal of Organization Design](https://www.springer.com/journal/41469) and serve on the editorial boards of Academy of Management Discoveries, Organization Science, and the Strategic Management Journal. My research has been published in Administrative Science Quarterly, Journal of Management, Organization Science, the Strategic Management Journal, and other outlets.

I received a PhD in Business Economics from LMU Munich, an MS in Industrial Engineering and Management from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and an MS in Engineering Management from Portland State University. Before joining SDU, I was an Assistant Professor at LMU Munich and a visiting scholar at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.
