By organizing effectively, firms can foster innovation. This course aims for students to develop competences to identify and reflect how organization design affects innovation, and to develop recommendations for action, based on a scientific and structured analysis and using theoretical frameworks. These competences and skills are relevant for students seeking a career in both private and public organizations, for example in functions such as business development, planning and organizing, innovation management, consulting, or entrepreneurship. The course also aims at allowing students to communicate a theoretically-guided written analysis in a clear and systematic manner. In doing so, it prepares students for major written assignments in academia (e.g., a masterâ€™s thesis), but also for a critical analysis and written communication in a practical context.
