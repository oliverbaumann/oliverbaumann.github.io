A good strategy is worth little unless it is implemented successfully. “Business Performance Management” is designed to help you turn your firm’s strategy into performance results. This
integrative course provides you with a comprehensive approach that follows the implementation process: (i) mapping your firm’s strategic choices and goals, (ii) aligning the organization to the goals, (iii) testing and adjusting the strategy, and (iv) establishing organizational conditions that foster performance. Participants will discuss a variety of frameworks (e.g., Balanced Scorecard, KPIs), well-tested tools (e.g., Strategy Maps), and numerous business cases that will clarify and enhance their thinking about strategy implementation and performance management. An integral part of the course is the Performance Management Audit – an individual application of the course tools and concepts to your own organization.
