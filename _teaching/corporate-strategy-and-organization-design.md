The course advances students’ knowledge and understanding in two interrelated domains: (1) “corporate strategy”, i.e., how multi-business organizations compete as a collection of multiple businesses; and (2) “organization design” that enables the implementation of such strategies. The course focuses on the question how firms can gain corporate advantage, i.e., advantage by competing as a collection of multiple businesses, and on the appropriate organization design to implement such strategy. The course enables students to apply advanced analytical frameworks to concrete organizational settings in order to analyze corporate strategy and organization design. The course also puts an emphasis on existing theories and how they can be used to inform an advanced analysis.
